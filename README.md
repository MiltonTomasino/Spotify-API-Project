# Spotify API Project

Basic api test to learn how they work. Only the search functionality works since I'm not willing to upload sensitive data onto github so that the login functionality works. Node.js must be installed for this code to work.

# Steps to get search working locally:

## 1. Open two terminal windows: one for the server, and the other for the app.
      ```
      cd spotify-api/           cd server/
      ```
## 2. Run `npm install` in the app terminal
## 3. Run `node index.js` in the server terminal
## 4. Run `npm start` in the app terminal to launch the app in a browser.
